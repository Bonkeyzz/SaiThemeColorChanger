# SaiThemeColorChanger
Recolors Sai2.exe to have a faux-dark theme

Drag the sai2.exe file into the executable to change the UI colors.  If you want to make your own custom colors, just edit the hex list in the source code.

ALSO MAKE SURE YOU BACK UP YOUR SAI FOLDER JUST TO BE SAFE LOL.  I haven't noticed any issues using a modified version for a couple months now, but still.
